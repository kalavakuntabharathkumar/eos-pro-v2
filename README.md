# Enterprise OS

A unified enterprise operating system covering HR, CRM, ERP, Finance, Projects, Analytics, Insights, Workflow Automation, Document Management, and Notifications — all in one platform with role-based access control and department-scoped data visibility.

> **Status:** Prototype / Enterprise Architecture Demonstration Project

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 19 + TypeScript
- Vite (build tool)
- Tailwind CSS v4 + Shadcn UI
- TanStack Query (server state)
- Zustand (client state)
- React Hook Form + Zod (validation)
- Recharts (charts)
- react-router-dom v7

### Backend
- Python 3.11 + FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- SQLite (file-based, zero-config)
- JWT authentication (PyJWT)
- PBKDF2/SHA-256 password hashing (`hashlib`)
- Uvicorn (ASGI server)

### Shared
- OpenAPI 3.0 spec (`lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml`) — source of truth for the API
- Orval — generates TanStack Query hooks and Zod schemas from the spec
- pnpm workspaces (monorepo)

---

## Security Features

- **JWT authentication** — stateless tokens, 7-day expiry, signed with a required `SECRET_KEY` env var
- **RBAC** — role and permission tables; middleware enforces permissions per endpoint
- **Scoped access control** — data visibility filtered by department membership
- **Department isolation** — employees see only their own department's data where applicable
- **Password hashing** — PBKDF2-SHA256 via `hashlib` (no third-party dependency)
- **No credentials in CORS** — `Authorization` header-based auth; wildcard origin is safe

---

## Features

- Personalized dashboards with role-scoped KPI cards and activity feeds
- Multi-step workflow approvals (leave requests, purchase orders)
- Scoped analytics — admins see org-wide data; employees see department data
- CSV export for employees, leads, attendance, and contacts (admin only)
- Document visibility controls (private / department / public)
- In-app notifications with role targeting
- Activity feed with user attribution and timestamps
- Module-specific Insights assistant with graceful fallback

---

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ and pnpm (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- Python 3.11

### Frontend

From the project root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @workspace/enterprise-os run dev
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` requests to the backend at `http://localhost:8000`.

> **Windows note:** `pnpm-workspace.yaml` excludes `esbuild`'s `win32` binaries by default (this project was originally built on a Linux environment). If `pnpm run dev` fails with `The package "@esbuild/win32-x64" could not be found`, remove the three `esbuild>@esbuild/win32-*` lines from the `overrides` section of `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, then run:
> ```bash
> rmdir /s /q node_modules && del pnpm-lock.yaml
> pnpm install --ignore-scripts
> ```
> The `--ignore-scripts` flag is needed because the root `preinstall` script uses `sh`, which isn't available in cmd/PowerShell by default.

### Backend

Python dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` at the **project root** (not inside `backend/`). Install from the root, then run the server from `backend/`:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows — use `source venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd backend
copy .env.example .env       # Windows — use `cp .env.example .env` on macOS/Linux
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Fill in `SECRET_KEY` in `.env` at minimum (see Environment Variables below). The database is created and seeded automatically on first startup. Delete `backend/enterprise_os.db` to reset.

> Note: there is also a `.env.example` in the project root — that one is a stray/unused file (references Postgres, which this project doesn't use). The one that matters is `backend/.env.example`.

### API codegen (after spec changes)

```bash
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen
```

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY` | **Yes** | JWT signing key — generate with `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `ENTERPRISE_DB_URL` | No | SQLite path. Default: `sqlite:///./enterprise_os.db` |

See `backend/.env.example` for a copy-paste template.

## Demo Credentials

| Role | Email | Password | Access |
|---|---|---|---|
| Admin | `admin@enterpriseos.com` | `admin123` | Full access — all modules, CSV export, user management |
| Super Admin | `superadmin@enterpriseos.com` | `super123` | Full access + system configuration |
| HR Manager | `hr@enterpriseos.com` | `hr1234` | Org-wide employee & leave data |
| Finance Manager | `finance@enterpriseos.com` | `finance123` | Finance module + own employee record |
| Project Manager | `pm@enterpriseos.com` | `pm1234` | Projects, tasks, milestones |
| Dept Head (Engineering) | `sarah.chen@co.com` | `dept1234` | Engineering dept employees & leaves |
| Dept Head (Sales) | `marcus.j@co.com` | `dept1234` | Sales dept employees & leaves |
| Employee | `employee@enterpriseos.com` | `employee123` | Own records, Projects, Insights, Notifications, Settings |

## Architecture Highlights

### Modular backend
Each domain (HRMS, CRM, Finance, etc.) is an isolated FastAPI router under `backend/app/api/routes/`. Adding a module means adding a router — no changes to other modules required.

### Scoped APIs
`backend/app/core/scoping.py` centralises data-visibility logic. Routers call scope helpers rather than writing raw filters, keeping access control consistent and auditable.

### Reusable widget system
Frontend dashboard widgets are independent components keyed to the auth context. Swapping a widget or adding a new KPI card requires no changes to layout or routing.

### Analytics architecture
Analytics queries are separated from CRUD routers. Aggregate endpoints return pre-computed summaries so the frontend never performs client-side aggregation over raw records.

### SQLite compatibility
The entire system runs on SQLite with no external database dependency — suitable for demos and single-server deployments. Schema migrations are applied via guarded `ALTER TABLE` statements on startup.
